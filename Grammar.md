Let G=(V,Σ,R,E) be a grammar, where V is the set of non-terminal symbols (or Variables) that
includes the start symbol E , Σ is the set of terminal symbols, and R is the set of production
rules. The grammar is specified as follows: <br />
V={E,T,F} <br />
Σ={+,&,−,(,),p,r} <br />
R={ <br />
E→E+T <br />
E→T <br />
T→T&F <br />
T→F <br />
F→(E <br />
F→−F <br />
F→p <br />
F→r <br />
