# Parser Tree
The aim of this coursework is to construct one version of a parser for a given context-free
language. It includes also to run and test such implementation on a few input strings, and
eventually to adapt the code so to deliver a parse-tree when this is possible.
In practice, you will be given:<br />
• A context-free grammar GG which generates the language LL<br /><br />
• Some input strings in the alphabet ΣΣ of terminals of GG<br />
• Description of the algorithm to decide whether or not a grammar generates a string<br />
• Java code which will include:<br />
o Classes for modelling context free grammars and their associated<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
components<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
o Classes for producing and displaying parse trees<br /><br /><br /><br />
o An interface IParser to which your code must conform<br /><br /><br />
o A skeleton class Parser which you can start modifying with your own code<br /><br />
o An interactive script which demos the code<br />
By the end of the full duration of the assignment you will have undertaken the following
tasks:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
• Transform GG into Chomsky Normal Form<br />
• Implement the algorithm that we provide to you to determine whether a given<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
string ww is generated by GG<br /><br /><br /><br />
• Run your implementation on the example strings as evidence for testing<br /><br /><br />
• Write code to adapt your implementation of the algorithm to produce a parse tree<br /><br />
for the given strings<br />
