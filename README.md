# Parser Tree
The aim of this coursework is to construct one version of a parser for a given context-free
language. It includes also to run and test such implementation on a few input strings, and
eventually to adapt the code so to deliver a parse-tree when this is possible.
In practice, you will be given:
• A context-free grammar GG which generates the language LL
• Some input strings in the alphabet ΣΣ of terminals of GG
• Description of the algorithm to decide whether or not a grammar generates a string
• Java code which will include:
o Classes for modelling context free grammars and their associated
components
o Classes for producing and displaying parse trees
o An interface IParser to which your code must conform
o A skeleton class Parser which you can start modifying with your own code
o An interactive script which demos the code
By the end of the full duration of the assignment you will have undertaken the following
tasks:
• Transform GG into Chomsky Normal Form
• Implement the algorithm that we provide to you to determine whether a given
string ww is generated by GG
• Run your implementation on the example strings as evidence for testing
• Write code to adapt your implementation of the algorithm to produce a parse tree
for the given strings
